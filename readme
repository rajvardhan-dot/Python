# day 3:
# modules and pip
# modules is use to borrow others code
# two types of modules
# 1)external : written by user (phone is the example, we dont know implementatio)
# 2) Built-in modules: install by pip(no need to install externally) these are already present module in python
# pip install pandas means i want to install a package name pandas, use for data analysis
# pip is package manager , means whatever things u wnat pip will bring and you can use that.

# day 4:

# a sequence of instruction will get evaluate using python

# day 5:
# escapse sequence , print , comments
# \n = escape
# ctrl + / = for commmet multiple lines
# \"rajvardhan\" = backslash use to put sentense in a string we can give 

# day 6:
# about variables: container who hold data
# int , string , float , double , char, boolean.
# *concatanation is possible between same type of data type variable
# *type(a) = use to know the type of variable
# *sequence data -> list , tuple
# *list is mutable(can be change) , tuple is immutable(can not change )
# *list is collection of different data element
# *dictionary datatype = data will store in key value pair(mapping);
# ***in python everything is a object***

# *string is a sequence of character
# *no functional difference between single quote and double quote

# types to print string
# single quote in last and double in between
# both side double quote
# both side triple quote to print large para with single and double quote
# #silicing in string
# print("hello"[0]) : to print first character

day20:
    functions:
        # use of pass in python is to tell program that skip this functiona and go for the next function execution 
        #later i will write this function
        #function is use to divide bigger problem into smaller
functions are two types:
    built-in: min,max,range,tuples,dict
    user define: by using def keyword


day 21:
    function argument (how to pass in the function)
    There are four types of arguments that we can provide in a function:

Default Arguments
Keyword Arguments
Variable length Arguments
Required Arguments

def name(*name): use to store tuple values
def name(**name):use to store value in the form of dcintionary 

day22:
    #about list uses
    #list comprehension
    #List Comprehension
List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.
    
    
day23:
    list method
    sort()
    reverse()

day24:
    for company program we will use the list
    in case where we dont want to others change the values 
    
day25:
    how we can manipulate the tuple by using the list
    tup()
    temp = list(tup)
    temp.append()
    tup = tuple(temp)
     ex:
         tup = (1,2,5,6,7,8)
            temp = list(tup)
            temp.append(70)
            tup = tuple(temp)
            print(tup)

    .2f:use to print value till two decimal place
    txt = f"for only {price:.2f} dollars!"
    print(f"hey my name is {{name}}  and I am from {{country}}"): double curly braces use to print as it is


***day29***
 docstring:will use after the declaration of the function, it is use to tell a user about the function that how many argument he needs to give
 we an not ignore docstring like the comments
 just after function name we will write docstring

    Recursion:
        
day31:
    sets: is a collection of well defined object

day32: 
    set function
    #union all common elements in both the sets , union will return
    #new set while update will modify the existing set
    #same for the intersection and intersection update
    III. symmetric_difference and symmetric_difference_update():same like the union does
    symmetric_difference: values which are not present in both set
    IV. difference() and difference_update():
        difference means:: Elements present on one set, but not on the other.
        
    The isdisjoint() method checks if items of given set are present in another set. This method returns False if items are present, else it returns True.
    
    issuperset():
The issuperset() method checks if all the items of a particular set are present in the original set. It returns True if all the items are present, else it returns False.

    issubset():
The issubset() method checks if all the items of the original set are present in the particular set. It returns True if all the items are present, else it returns False.
 
    add()
If you want to add a single item to the set use the add() method.

    update()
If you want to add more than one item, simply create another set or any other iterable object(list, tuple, dictionary), and use the update() method to add it into the existing set

   remove()/discard()
We can use remove() and discard() methods to remove items form list.
   
pop()
This method removes the last item of the se

del
del is not a method, rather it is a keyword which deletes the set entirely.
    
clear():
This method clears all items in the set and prints an empty set.

 Check if item exists
You can also check if an item exists in the set or not.


day33:
    dcintionary
    
day34:
    set unordered and dictionary is unordered
  popitem():
The popitem() method removes the last key-value pair from the dictionary.
pop():
The pop() method removes the key-value pair whose key is passed as a parameter.


clear():
The clear() method removes all the items from the list.
update()
The update() method updates the value of the key provided to it if the item already exists in the dictionary, else it creates a new key-value pai

del:
we can also use the del keyword to remove a dictionary item.

day35:

day52:
    lambda function: it's means that we are making variable of a function and using
    use it only for one liner solution
    when we pass function as an argument inside another function(most imp use)
    
    # In Python, a lambda function is a small anonymous function without a name. It is defined using the lambda keyword and has the following syntax:
    
    # lambda arguments: expression
# Lambda functions are often used in situations where a small function is required for a short period of time. They are commonly used as arguments to higher-order functions, such as map, filter, and reduce.
     
     day53:
     map is a short form to iterate in a list of item and convert them in any other for
     
     day54:
     both are comparesion operator
     is will compare the exact location of object in the memory 
     == wil compare the value of the object in the memory

example:
a = [1,2,3]
b = [1,2,3]
print(a is b)#exact location of object(false)
print(a == b)#value of the object(True)

    intro to oops and best example is GTA VICE CITY (WORKING OF PLAYER INSIDE THE GAME )
    class in a blueprint
    object are real time entity that we will use to make the function
    
    day57:
    example of class
    class is like a placeholder
    class is like a template
    
    self: means the object for which this method is called, basically current object ko point krta hain
    
    
    day58:
    
    in each and every method we need to give a self inside any method
    constructors called automatically when object create
    it help initialize the Value
    it return None
    
    
    day59:
    Decorators:
    from word only u can understand that to decorate something, so samething we r doing here decorating the function by modifying the other function
    it allows you to modify the behavior of function or method 
    this is the way to ectend the functionality
    
    *args: method of tkaing values in the form of tuples
    **kwargs: method of taking values in the form of dictionary

    '''Access specifiers or access modifiers in python programming are used to limit the access of class variables and class methods outside of class while implementing the concepts of inheritance.
    Public Access Specifier in Python
    All the variables and methods (member functions) 
    in python are by default public. Any instance variable in 
    a class followed by the ‘self’ keyword ie. self.var_name are public accessed.'''
    
    In Python, there is no strict concept of "private" access modifiers like in 
    some other programming languages. However, a convention has been established to indicate that a variable 
    or method should be considered private by prefixing its name with a double underscore (__). This is known as a "weak internal use indicator" 
    and it is a convention only, not a strict rule. Code outside the class can still access these "private" variables and methods, but it is generally understood that they should not be accessed or modified.
    
    '''It's important to note that the single underscore is 
    just a naming convention, and does not actually provide any protection or restrict access to the member. 
    The syntax we follow to make any variable protected is to write variable name followed by a single underscore (_) ie. _varName.'''
    
    
    day65:
        '''Static methods in Python are methods that belong to a class rather than 
        an instance of the class. They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator 
        and do not have access to the instance of the class (i.e. self). They are called on the class itself, 
        not on an instance of the class. Static methods are often used to create utility functions that don't need access to instance data.'''
        
    ek aisa method banana chahte ho ki jo bhi class use kre vo iss method ka use kre
    
    day66:
        instances and class variables
        Class variables are defined at the class level and are shared among all instances of the class.
        Instance variables are defined at the instance level and are unique to each instance of the class. They are defined inside the init method and are usually used to store information that is specific to each instance of the class.
