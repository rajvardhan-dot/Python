# day 3:
# modules and pip
# modules is use to borrow others code
# two types of modules
# 1)external : written by user (phone is the example, we dont know implementatio)
# 2) Built-in modules: install by pip(no need to install externally) these are already present module in python
# pip install pandas means i want to install a package name pandas, use for data analysis
# pip is package manager , means whatever things u wnat pip will bring and you can use that.

# day 4:

# a sequence of instruction will get evaluate using python

# day 5:
# escapse sequence , print , comments
# \n = escape
# ctrl + / = for commmet multiple lines
# \"rajvardhan\" = backslash use to put sentense in a string we can give 

# day 6:
# about variables: container who hold data
# int , string , float , double , char, boolean.
# *concatanation is possible between same type of data type variable
# *type(a) = use to know the type of variable
# *sequence data -> list , tuple
# *list is mutable(can be change) , tuple is immutable(can not change )
# *list is collection of different data element
# *dictionary datatype = data will store in key value pair(mapping);
# ***in python everything is a object***

# day7:
# Operators:
# 1)Arithmetic operators
# 2)Assignment operators
# 3)Comparison operators
# 4)Logical operators
# 5)Identity operators
# 6)Membership operators
# 7)Bitwise operators 

# print(15 // 6) : floor division operator means when you want floor value
# print(15 % 6) : modulus operator means when you want remainder value
# print(15 ** 6) : power operator means when you want power value

# print("the value of " , a , "+" , b,"is:",a+b) : concatenation

# day8:
# ***alt+shift+downarrow-> line will replicate***
# ***alt+shift+uparrow-> line will delete***

# day9:
# *typecasting: conversion of one datatype to other called typecasting
# *explicit conversion: when i will do conversion
# *implicit conversion: when python will do conversion
# *implicit conversion is not possible in python
# * according to the level in implicit one datatype convert to other type
# *pyhton convert smaller datatype to a higher datatype
# *int to float

# day10:
# user input
# *input() function is used to take input from user
# *input() function will take input as string
# *int(input()) function will take input as integer
# *float(input()) function will take input as float

# day11:
# string in python
# *string is a sequence of character
# *no functional difference between single quote and double quote

# types to print string
# single quote in last and double in between
# both side double quote
# both side triple quote to print large para with single and double quote
# #silicing in string
# print("hello"[0]) : to print first character
# #looping in string
# for i in "hello":
# print(i) : to print all character

# day12:
# len() : function
# slicing : square bracket use for slicing
# string is immutable

# day13:
# if else conditional statement in python

# all string function to perform with the str
# strip(): Removes characters from both ends.
# lstrip(): Removes characters from the beginning (left side).
# rstrip(): Removes characters from the end (right side).

#day14:
if else statement

#day15
excercise

#day16
about match case

day17
about looping statement

day 18

day 19

day20:
    functions:
        # use of pass in python is to tell program that skip this functiona and go for the next function execution 
        #later i will write this function
        #function is use to divide bigger problem into smaller
functions are two types:
    built-in: min,max,range,tuples,dict
    user define: by using def keyword


day 21:
    function argument (how to pass in the function)
    There are four types of arguments that we can provide in a function:

Default Arguments
Keyword Arguments
Variable length Arguments
Required Arguments

def name(*name): use to store tuple values
def name(**name):use to store value in the form of dcintionary 

day22:
    #about list uses
    #list comprehension
    #List Comprehension
List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.
    
    
day23:
    list method
    sort()
    reverse()
    append()
    index()
    copy()
    insert()
    extend()
